# myAja - Personalized Supplement Recommendation App 💊

A React Native Expo application that provides personalized supplement recommendations based on user health goals, medical conditions, and lifestyle. Features intelligent recommendation engine, progress tracking, and intake monitoring.

## 📱 Project Overview

**myAja** helps users:
- Complete health onboarding with medical screening
- Receive personalized supplement recommendations grouped by health objectives
- Track daily supplement intake
- Monitor progress and adherence over time
- Access educational content about supplements

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (React Native + Expo)
- **Framework**: Expo SDK 54 with React Native 0.81.5
- **Navigation**: Custom state-based navigation system
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with AsyncStorage persistence
- **API Client**: Axios with request interceptors
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet with custom theme

### Backend (Mock Express Server)
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Storage**: In-memory (for development)
- **CORS**: Enabled for local development
- **Authentication**: Mock JWT tokens

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended)
- Expo Go app on your mobile device

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
docker compose up

# Or start them separately
docker compose up backend
docker compose up app
```

The app will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8081 (web) or scan QR code with Expo Go
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000

### Option 2: Local Development

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

## 📱 Testing on Mobile

1. Install **Expo Go** on your iOS or Android device
2. Ensure your device is on the same network as your computer
3. Start the app: `docker compose up` or `npx expo start`
4. Scan the QR code with:
   - **iOS**: Camera app
   - **Android**: Expo Go app

### Network Configuration

The app is configured to work on your local network. The `docker-compose.yml` includes:
```yaml
environment:
  - REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=10.0.0.46  # Update this to your local IP
  - EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://10.0.0.46:8000
```

**To update for your network:**
1. Find your local IP: `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux) or `ipconfig` (Windows)
2. Update the IP addresses in `docker-compose.yml`
3. Restart: `docker compose down && docker compose up`

## 🔌 API Integration

### Frontend API Service (`services/api.ts`)

All backend communication goes through `services/api.ts`:

```typescript
// Authentication
signup(email, password)
login(email, password)

// User Management
getMe()
updateMyProfile(payload)

// Recommendations & Decision Engine
getDecisionForMe()          // Recommendations screen
trackSupplementIntake(id, taken)

// Progress & Dashboard
getProgress()               // Suivi/tracking screen
getDashboard()              // Dashboard screen
```

### Environment Variables

The API base URL is configured via environment variable:
```typescript
export const API_BASE_URL = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://127.0.0.1:8000";
```

Set in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
environment:
  - EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://10.0.0.46:8000
```

## 🗄️ Backend Endpoints

See [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md) for detailed documentation.

**Quick Reference:**
- `POST /auth/signup` - Create account
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate
- `GET /users/me` - Get current user
- `PUT /users/me/profile` - Update profile (onboarding)
- `GET /decide/me` - Get personalized recommendations grouped by goals ⭐
- `POST /supplements/intake` - Track supplement intake
- `GET /tracking/progress` - Get progress data (charts, heatmaps)
- `GET /dashboard` - Get dashboard summary

- Custom circular progress indicators

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User signs up with email/password
2. Backend returns JWT token + user object
3. Token stored in AsyncStorage
4. Token automatically attached to all API requests via Axios interceptor
5. User redirected to onboarding (if profile incomplete) or dashboard

## 📊 Data Flow

### Onboarding → Recommendations
```
User completes onboarding
    ↓
Profile saved to backend (PUT /users/me/profile)
    ↓
Backend analyzes goals & medical conditions
    ↓
Frontend fetches recommendations (GET /decide/me)
    ↓
Recommendations grouped by objective and displayed
```

### Intake Tracking → Progress
```
User marks supplement as taken
    ↓
Frontend sends intake (POST /supplements/intake)
    ↓
Backend stores with timestamp
    ↓
Progress/Dashboard screens fetch updated data
    ↓
Charts and heatmaps reflect new data
```

## 🔄 Recent Changes & Improvements

### Backend Integration (February 2026)
- ✅ Added `/decide/me` endpoint for grouped recommendations
- ✅ Added `/dashboard` endpoint for overview
- ✅ Added `/tracking/progress` endpoint with analytics
- ✅ Added supplement intake tracking with persistence
- ✅ Implemented recommendation filtering based on contraindications
- ✅ Added support for environment variable configuration

### Frontend Updates
- ✅ Connected Dashboard screen to real backend data
- ✅ Connected Suivi/Tracking screen with charts and analytics
- ✅ Maintained student's sophisticated Recommendations screen implementation
- ✅ Added loading states for all data fetching
- ✅ Added error handling with graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates for intake tracking

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Persistence
**All backend data is in-memory and will be lost on restart!**
- User accounts
- User profiles
- Intake history
- Progress data

After backend restart, users must:
1. Sign up again with a new email
2. Complete onboarding again

### Development vs Production
This is a **development setup** with:
- ❌ Plain text password storage
- ❌ Mock JWT tokens
- ❌ No database
- ❌ No data validation
- ⚠️ **NOT production-ready!**

### Known Limitations
1. Backend restarts clear all data (in-memory storage)
2. No real-time synchronization between devices
3. Limited supplement library (3 supplements)
4. Simplified recommendation algorithm
5. No user profile editing after onboarding

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Flow

1. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

2. **Open on mobile** (scan QR code with Expo Go)

3. **Test complete flow:**
   - Sign up with email/password
   - Complete all 6 onboarding steps
   - View dashboard (should show your name and 0% progress)
   - Go to Recommendations tab (should show personalized plan)
   - Mark supplements as taken (checkboxes)
   - Go to Suivi tab (should show progress charts)
   - Go back to Dashboard (should show updated progress)

### Testing Endpoints Directly

```bash
# Sign up
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'

# Get recommendations (use token from signup response)
curl http://localhost:8000/decide/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mock_token_user_1_..."
```

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a student project for MSE (Master of Science in Engineering).

### Key Guidelines
- Maintain compatibility with existing frontend implementation
- Update backend README when adding new endpoints
- Test on both web and mobile before committing
- Keep the mock nature clearly documented
- Respect the student's original design patterns (especially in RecommendationsScreen)

### Code Style

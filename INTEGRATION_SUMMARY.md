# Backend Integration Summary 🔌

**Date**: February 16, 2026
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Tested

This document summarizes the backend integration work completed for the myAja application.

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

### Problem
The application had fully functional frontend screens but all data was hardcoded/mocked:
- Dashboard showed static progress (75%)
- Recommendations showed 3 hardcoded supplements
- Tracking screen had random mock data
- No persistence of user actions

### Solution
Integrated a full Express.js backend with:
- User authentication & profile management
- Personalized supplement recommendations
- Intake tracking with persistence
- Progress analytics and dashboard aggregation

---

## 📋 Changes by Component

### 1. Backend Server (`backend/server.js`)

**NEW Endpoints Added:**

#### `GET /decide/me` ⭐ (Main recommendation endpoint)
- Returns personalized supplement recommendations grouped by user's health goals
- Filters out contraindicated supplements based on medical conditions
- Includes current intake status for each supplement
- Format matches what your RecommendationsScreen expects

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "decision": {
    "plan_par_objectif": {
      "sleep_support": [
        {
          "id": "mag_bisgly",
          "produit": "Magnésium Bisglycinate",
          "posologie": "300mg",
          "timing": "evening",
          "justification": "Favorise la relaxation...",
          "molecules": ["Magnésium", "Glycine"],
          "warning": "Prendre 30 min avant le coucher",
          "symptomes_couverts": ["sleep_support", "stress_anxiety_support"],
          "taken": false
        }
      ]
    },
    "goals": ["sleep_support", "immune_support"]
  }
}
```

#### `POST /supplements/intake`
- Tracks when user marks a supplement as taken
- Stores timestamp for analytics
- Updates intake status in real-time

**Request:**
```json
{
  "supplement_id": "mag_bisgly",
  "taken": true
}
```

#### `GET /tracking/progress`
- Comprehensive progress analytics
- Returns:
  - Evolution curve (10 days)
  - Weekly adherence
  - Monthly heatmap
  - Today's intake log with timestamps

#### `GET /dashboard`
- Dashboard summary endpoint
- Returns user name, progress %, supplement counts, weekly data

#### `GET /supplements/recommendations` (Legacy)
- Simpler flat list format (not grouped by goals)
- Available as alternative endpoint

**Data Structures Added:**
```javascript
// Supplement library (3 supplements)
const SUPPLEMENT_LIBRARY = [
  {
    id: 'mag_bisgly',
    name: 'Magnésium Bisglycinate',
    dosage: '300mg',
    timing: 'evening',
    goals: ['sleep_support', 'stress_anxiety_support'],
    conditions_avoid: []
  },
  // ... Vitamine D3, Oméga-3
]

// Intake tracking database
const supplementIntakes = new Map(); // userId -> array of intake records
```

---

### 2. Frontend API Service (`services/api.ts`)

**KEPT Your Implementation:**
- ✅ `getDecisionForMe()` - Your function for recommendations
- ✅ `DecideMeResponse` type - Your type definition

**ADDED New Functions:**
```typescript
// Progress & Dashboard (for other screens)
getProgress(): Promise<ProgressResponse>
getDashboard(): Promise<DashboardResponse>
```

**IMPROVED:**
- Changed `API_BASE_URL` to use environment variable:
```typescript
export const API_BASE_URL = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://127.0.0.1:8000";
```

---

### 3. Dashboard Screen (`components/screens/dashboard-screen.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `useEffect` hook to fetch data on mount
- ✅ Added loading state with ActivityIndicator
- ✅ Connected to `GET /dashboard` endpoint
- ✅ Now shows real user name (from profile)
- ✅ Now shows real supplement counts
- ✅ Now shows real progress percentage
- ✅ Now shows real weekly adherence

**Before:**
```typescript
const todayProgress = 75; // Hardcoded
const userName = "Marie"; // Hardcoded
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [dashboardData, setDashboardData] = useState<DashboardResponse | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  loadDashboard(); // Fetches from backend
}, []);

const displayName = dashboardData?.user_name || userName || "User";
const todayProgress = dashboardData?.today_progress || 0;
```

---

### 4. Recommendations Screen (`components/screens/recommendations-screen.tsx`)

**NO CHANGES - Your Implementation Kept 100%! ✅**

Your sophisticated implementation was preserved:
- Complex data transformation layer
- Support for multiple response formats
- Grouping by objectives
- Local state management with `takenById`
- All your helper functions (normalizeObjectiveKey, prettifyObjectiveLabel, etc.)

**Why?** Your implementation is excellent and handles the `/decide/me` endpoint perfectly.

---

### 5. Suivi/Tracking Screen (`components/screens/suivi-screen.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `useEffect` hook to fetch data
- ✅ Added loading state
- ✅ Connected to `GET /tracking/progress` endpoint
- ✅ Now shows real evolution data
- ✅ Now shows real daily intakes with timestamps
- ✅ Now shows real monthly heatmap
- ✅ Added graceful handling for empty data

**Before:**
```typescript
const evolutionData = [
  { day: 1, value: 45 }, // Hardcoded
  // ...
];
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [progressData, setProgressData] = useState<ProgressResponse | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  loadProgress(); // Fetches from backend
}, []);

const evolutionData = progressData?.evolution_data || [];
```

**Added Empty State:**
```typescript
{evolutionData.length > 0 ? (
  <LineChart ... />
) : (
  <View>
    <Text>Pas encore de données</Text>
  </View>
)}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes for You

### Data Persistence
⚠️ **All data is in-memory and will be lost when backend restarts!**

After `docker compose restart backend`:
- All users deleted
- All intake history lost
- You need to sign up again

This is normal for development. For production, you'll need a real database.

### Network Configuration
If testing on mobile, update your IP in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
environment:
  - REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=YOUR_IP_HERE  # e.g., 192.168.1.100
  - EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://YOUR_IP_HERE:8000
```

Find your IP:
- Mac/Linux: `ifconfig`
- Windows: `ipconfig`

Then restart: `docker compose down && docker compose up`

### Recommendation Algorithm
Current algorithm is simple:
1. Match supplements to user's goals
2. Filter out contraindicated supplements
3. Return with intake status

Example: If user takes anticoagulants, Oméga-3 is excluded.

You can expand this by:
- Adding more supplements to `SUPPLEMENT_LIBRARY`
- Adding more contraindication rules
- Connecting to a real ML model or decision engine

## 🎓 Learning Points

### What You Can Learn From This Integration:

1. **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
2. **State Management**: Using React hooks (useState, useEffect)
3. **Async Operations**: Loading states, error handling
4. **Docker**: Containerization and networking
5. **Data Transformation**: Backend → Frontend format mapping
6. **Authentication Flow**: JWT tokens, interceptors
7. **Real-time Updates**: Optimistic UI updates

### Next Steps for Your Learning:

1. **Add More Supplements**: Expand `SUPPLEMENT_LIBRARY` in `backend/server.js`
2. **Add Database**: Replace in-memory storage with PostgreSQL
3. **Improve Algorithm**: Add more sophisticated recommendation logic
4. **Add Features**: Push notifications, social sharing, etc.
5. **Add Tests**: Unit tests for API functions, integration tests

## 🤝 Collaboration Notes

Your sophisticated RecommendationsScreen implementation was excellent! The data transformation layer you built handles multiple response formats beautifully. I kept it 100% unchanged and built the backend to match your expected format.

The integration respects your architecture:
- Custom navigation system preserved
- AuthContext untouched
- Your naming conventions followed
- Your data structures respected

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixed

During testing, I discovered a **token parsing bug** that was preventing all authenticated endpoints from working.

**The Problem:**
- Token format: `mock_token_user_1_1771232610502`
- Code was splitting by `_` and taking `tokenParts[2]` = `'user'`
- Then prepending `'user_'` to make `'user_user'` ❌
- Correct userId should be `'user_1'` ✅

**The Fix:**
Created `extractUserIdFromToken()` helper that properly extracts the userId by removing the prefix and timestamp suffix.

**Result:** All 72 tests now pass! ✅

---

## 🧪 Test Suite

A comprehensive test suite has been added: `backend/test.js`

**Coverage:**
- ✅ 72 tests total
- ✅ Unit tests (helper functions)
- ✅ Integration tests (all endpoints)
- ✅ End-to-end workflow tests
- ✅ Smoke tests (endpoint availability)

**Run tests:**

cd backend
node test.js
```

**Expected result:**
```
✓ Passed: 72
✗ Failed: 0
Total:   72
Time:    0.04s

🎉 All tests passed!
```
